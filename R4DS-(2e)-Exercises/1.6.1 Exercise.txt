1. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
  The ggsave() function at the end of the lines of code above will only save the most recent plot created. Thus, it will save the scatterplot where x = cty and y = hwy--not the one with bar chart.

2. What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG? How could you find out what types of image files would work in ggsave()?
  Well, we can simply change the extension of the file to .pdf instead of .png.
  For further information, we can always check the documentation of the dunction by running ?____
