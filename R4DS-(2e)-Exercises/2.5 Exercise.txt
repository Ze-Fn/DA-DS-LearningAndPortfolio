1. Why does this code not work?

my_variable <- 10
my_varıable
#> Error: object 'my_varıable' not found

Look carefully! (This may seem like an exercise in pointlessness, but training your brain to notice even the tiniest difference will pay off when programming.)

  A: the object created has i on it, the called object uses l instead of i, which makes RStudio to return an error message.

2. Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly:

libary(todyverse)

ggplot(dTA = mpg) + 
  geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm)

  A:
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")


3. Press Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K. What happens? How can you get to the same place using the menus?

4. Let’s revisit an exercise from the Section 1.6. Run the following lines of code. Which of the two plots is saved as mpg-plot.png? Why?

my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)

  The code will save the first plot. Why, one might ask. Well, it is because there is an argument in the ggsave() function that specifies which plot to save from which object.
