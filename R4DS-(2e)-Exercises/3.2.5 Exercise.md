# 3.2.5 Exercise
1. In a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:

* Had an arrival delay of two or more hours
```R
flights |>
  filter(arr_delay >= 200)
```
* Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)
```R
flights |>
  filter(dest == "IAH" | dest == "HOU")
```
* Were operated by United, American, or Delta
```R
flights |>
  filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
```
* Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
```R
flights |>
  filter(month %in% c(7,9))
```
* Arrived more than two hours late but didn’t leave late
```R
flights |>
  filter(arr_delay > 200 & dep_delay == 0)
```
* Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```R
flights |>
  filter(dep_delay >= 100 & air_time > 30)
```

2. Sort flights to find the flights with the longest departure delays. Find the flights that left earliest in the morning.

```R
flights |>
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) |>
  arrange(sched_dep_time < 1)
```

3. Sort flights to find the fastest flights. (Hint: Try including a math calculation inside of your function.)

```R
flights |>
  arrange(air_time)
```
4. Was there a flight on every day of 2013?

```R
flights |>
  filter(year == 2013) |>
  count(day)
```

6. Which flights traveled the farthest distance? Which traveled the least distance?
```R
flights |>
  arrange(desc(distance))

flight |>
  arrange(distance)
```

7. Does it matter what order you used filter() and arrange() if you’re using both? Why/why not? Think about the results and how much work the functions would have to do.
```txt
It would be best practice to do filter() first then arrange(). If one arrange() first then filter(), it would take another step of arrange() is needed.
```
