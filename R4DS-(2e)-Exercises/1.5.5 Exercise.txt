1. The mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains 234 observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 car models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?
  A: Categorical variable can be identified by looking at its data type, i.e. <chr>. On the other hand, numerical data type usually comes with <dbl> or <int>.

2. Make a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ, color = year)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ, size = year)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ, size = year, color = year)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ, 
                color = cty, 
                size = cty, 
                shape = drv)) +
  geom_point()

  To be honest, I didn't understand the question. The wording of the second sentence was quite vague and ambiguous. "Next, map a third, numerical variable ..." This one got me confused. I think it should be better if the comma is omitted. By doing so, I could understand that I had to insert a third numerical variable into the plot.


3. In the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?
  A: No changes.


4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
  A: Say we want to plot hwy and map it x, y, color, shape, and size.
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = hwy, color = hwy, shape = hwy, size = hwy)) +
    geom_point()

  The scatterplot will have hwy on X-axis and Y-axis
                            different colors for each different hwy value
                            various shapes for each different hwy value (correction: shapes can't take continuous value)
                            distinct sizes for each different hwy value


5. Make a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm and color the points by species. What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()

  So, it's about seeing all penguins in a single, one plot vs. seeing three faceted plots based on species
  The all-in-one scatterplot will give you a sense comparison but I think it would feel exhausting to see all at once. The faceting method, on the other hand, allows us to see all of the species on each different plot, so that it is less exhausting to see. We get to get a clearer, more distinctive, more comparable view of three different plots faceted by species.

6. Why does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(
    x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
    color = species, shape = species
  )
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color = "Species")

  Just add this argument in the  labs() function:
  shape = "Species"
  By doing so, both color and shape will be combined under one legend called "Species".

7. Create the two following stacked bar plots. Which question can you answer with the first one? Which question can you answer with the second one?

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

  First script: What is the percentage of penguin specieses on each island?
  Second script: Where do each penguin specieses live?
