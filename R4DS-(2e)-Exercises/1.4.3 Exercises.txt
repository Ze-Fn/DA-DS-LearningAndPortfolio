1. Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?
  A: 
  library(palmerpenguins)
  ggplot(penguins, aes(y = species)) +
    geom_bar()

    The plots has a different variables being shown compared the previous lines of code. This one shows species vs count(species). Since the variable is assigned to the y aesthetic, the bar graph is horizontal.

2. How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(color = "red")

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "red")

  Prediction:
  I think the fill argument fits more compared to color argument in the case of geom_bar. The geom_bar has "bars" (obviously) and we want to paint it. Painting an object is called "fill".
  Output: 
  The color argument only changes the outline of the bar. The fill argument, however, changes the entire bar into the desired color.

  
3. What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?
  A: bins is the interval number from one bar to another.

4. Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?
  A: I think the binwidth of 0.20 is the most interesting because it is close to resemble a bell.
