## Problem 
Why do students perform lower on summative assessment of Informatics? 

## Hypotheses
1. The summative assessment does not measure what the students learned during their learning period. 
2. The students did not study for their test.
3. The teacher did not teach the materials included in the assessment.

## Data Collection Procedure
1. Request access file to the teacher who is responsible for storing students' exam data (i.e. Curriculum Division).
2. Download a copy of the original files.

## Variables
* Student Name
* Class
* Each Questions
* Total score

## Analytics Type to be Used
* Descriptive
* Prescriptive
* Diagnostic

## Analysis Procedure
1. Access the file in a data processing software (i.e. Excel).
2. Since the files are already populated with students' responses and total score of each student, data cleaning process is reduced but not completely skipped or neglected.
3. Group the students by class and make a separate table out of it. 
4. Sort the data by descending order, by the total score. 
5. Convert all responses from long strings into 1 character string either A, B, C, or D identical to the original response. 
6.
