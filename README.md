<h2>File naming convention</h2>
<p>I used my own naming convention for all of my files. Files that start with 'B' are 'Beginner'. This is the very basic of the basics. I learn and practice basic stuff in there. The numbering after the 'B' is meant for the order in which I learned it. B3 means it is the third lesson that I have learned. You may notice that there is no B1 in my repository. Well, this is because the numbering system is actually reflecting what AlexTheAnalys' (YouTube) taught me. Therefore, the B1 is for the installation of MySQL in my system.
There is also 'I'. It stands for 'Intermediate'. The same numbering system as in the previous paragraph applies here.</p>
<h3>List of File Naming</h3>
<ol>
  <li>B = Beginner</li>
  <li>I = Intermediate</li>
  <li>X = Advanced</li>
  <li>LRN = Learning</li>
</ol>
