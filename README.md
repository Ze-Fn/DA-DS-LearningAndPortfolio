<h2 id="FileNameConvent">File naming convention</h2>
<p>I used a hierarchial numerical naming system to organize My SQL files (pun intended). Previously, I used my own custom file naming convention but then realized that it was not efficient. I kept thinking of the way to make the list convenient and easy to read not only for me but also for other people. Therefore, I used this multilevel hierarchial numbering system. Honestly, I should have realized this naming system sooner.</p>
<h3>Multilevel List Numbers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 = Beginner</li>
  <li>2 = Intermediate</li>
  <li>3 = Advanced</li>
</ul>
